This is a personal website of mine, [@Veetaha]. I post everything that interests me here, 99% of which is programming :D

## Acknowledgment

I owe a lot of my knowledge to these people:

* [@DevInCube], a teacher who introduced me into the awesome art of programming for the first two years in the university, and inspired me to grow;
* [@matklad], who ultimately helped me become the developer I am today by reviewing my code in their open source project [rust-analyzer];
* [@anelson], who hired me for a startup project and shared invaluable experience of making a commertial product with a team.

You guys are as pationate and as awesome as you can be, thank you so much for investing into me!
