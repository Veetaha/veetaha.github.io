# [@Veetaha]

Welcome! This is the place, where I share my knowledge with people, where 99% of that is programming with the domination of Rust language.

You can find any blog posts of interest in the sidebar to the left.

## Acknowledgment

I owe a lot of my knowledge to these people:

* [@DevInCube], a teacher who introduced me o the awesome art of programming for the first two years in the university, and inspired me to grow;
* [@matklad], who ultimately helped me become the developer I am today by reviewing my code in their open source project [rust-analyzer];
* [@anelson], who hired me for a startup project and shared invaluable experience of making a commercial product with a team.

You guys are as passionate and as awesome as you can be, thank you so much for investing in me ðŸ˜‹!
